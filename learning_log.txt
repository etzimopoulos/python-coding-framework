File used to keep track of my learning, including links I've used as I go along.

Day 1 - 28/06/22
- Created new local and repote repository in Git
- Tested I can update local from remote and also push to remote by adding a README and doing minor updates

Day 2 - 29/06/22
- Installed Python3.9 in Ubuntu, upgrading from current 3.7.6
- Used the following article as reference - https://www.itsupportwale.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-to-python-3-9-0-on-ubuntu-18-04-lts/
- This creates 2 versions for Python interpreter
- To learn more about how to use "update-alternatives" to select any of them by default or manually I read through this article: https://linuxhint.com/update_alternatives_ubuntu/
- Next day: 
1. To complete switching to 3.9 and configure update-alternatives properly
2. To go through PyCharm installation in Linux (have it already in Windows but want to work of the Linux-VMBox)
