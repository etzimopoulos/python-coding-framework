# Udemy Course: A Python project with coding framework and unit testing
File used to keep track of my learning, including links I've used as I go along.

*** Day 1 - 28/06/22 ***
- Created new local and repote repository in Git
- Tested I can update local from remote and also push to remote by adding a README and doing minor updates

*** Day 2 - 29/06/22 *** 
- Installed Python3.9 in Ubuntu, upgrading from current 3.7.6
- Used the following article as reference - https://www.itsupportwale.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-to-python-3-9-0-on-ubuntu-18-04-lts/
- This creates 2 versions for Python interpreter
- To learn more about how to use "update-alternatives" to select any of them by default or manually I read through this article: https://linuxhint.com/update_alternatives_ubuntu/
- Next day: 
1. To complete switching to 3.9 and configure update-alternatives properly
2. To go through PyCharm installation in Linux (have it already in Windows but want to work of the Linux-VMBox)

*** Day 3 - 04/07/2022 *** 
- Configured update-alternatives to use Python3 by default instead of Python 2. Article reference:
https://linuxhint.com/update_alternatives_ubuntu/
- Using "python --version" or "python3 -V" command still gives me 3.7.6 so something is not working right
- Update-alteratives is setup as per article both for "python" or "python3":

e.g. results when querying for python or python3

(base) etzimopoulos@dell-ubuntu-vm:~/Google-Drive/Career/Data Science/GitHub/python-coding-framework$ update-alternatives --query python
Name: python
Link: /usr/local/bin/python
Status: auto
Best: /usr/bin/python3.9
Value: /usr/bin/python3.9

Alternative: /home/etzimopoulos/anaconda3/bin/python3
Priority: 40

Alternative: /usr/bin/python2
Priority: 20

Alternative: /usr/bin/python3.9
Priority: 60

(base) etzimopoulos@dell-ubuntu-vm:~/Google-Drive/Career/Data Science/GitHub/python-coding-framework$ update-alternatives --query python3
Name: python3
Link: /usr/local/bin/python3
Status: auto
Best: /usr/bin/python3.9
Value: /usr/bin/python3.9

Alternative: /usr/bin/python3.9
Priority: 80

----- Final solution -----
In the end, a simple alias worked:
Step 1 - Added the following to .bashrc 
    alias python="python3.9"

Step 2 - Restarted .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Worked. Now "python --version" gives me 3.9.13, while "python3 --version" gives me the default python 3.7.6

Also:
1. Removed all the update alternatives for "python" or "python3"
2. Re-installed PyCharm in VM box and now is working.
3. Created the First project and checked into Git

Sorted!

*** Day 4 - 06/07/2022 *** 
Python Learning - going quickly through this chapter to make sure I don't miss anything
 
- Dictionaries - when retrieving values that don't exist there are two ways to do that:
1) my_dict['key_value_doesnt_exist'] - referencing that key will throw an error as there's no such key as 'key_value_doesnt_exist'
2) alternatively can use get() function: my_dict.get('key_value_doesnt_exist') which will return "None" if value doesn't exist and program is not going to terminate with error. 

Note "None" is considered as False in Python (for boolean statements)



*** Day 5  - 18/07/2022 ***
Section 3: Organising code, logging and error handling
10. Initializing variables with a constructor - completed this and run without issues
Started documenting sequence diagram of interactions in slide deck (not completed)
