File used to keep track of my learning, including links I've used as I go along.

Day 1 - 28/06/22
- Created new local and repote repository in Git
- Tested I can update local from remote and also push to remote by adding a README and doing minor updates

Day 2 - 29/06/22
- Installed Python3.9 in Ubuntu, upgrading from current 3.7.6
- Used the following article as reference - https://www.itsupportwale.com/blog/how-to-upgrade-to-python-3-9-0-on-ubuntu-18-04-lts/
- This creates 2 versions for Python interpreter
- To learn more about how to use "update-alternatives" to select any of them by default or manually I read through this article: https://linuxhint.com/update_alternatives_ubuntu/
- Next day: 
1. To complete switching to 3.9 and configure update-alternatives properly
2. To go through PyCharm installation in Linux (have it already in Windows but want to work of the Linux-VMBox)

Day 3 - 04/07/2022
- Configured update-alternatives to use Python3 by default instead of Python 2. Article reference:
https://linuxhint.com/update_alternatives_ubuntu/
- Using "python --version" or "python3 -V" command still gives me 3.7.6 so something is not working right
- Update-alteratives is setup as per article both for "python" or "python3":

e.g. results when querying for python or python3

(base) etzimopoulos@dell-ubuntu-vm:~/Google-Drive/Career/Data Science/GitHub/python-coding-framework$ update-alternatives --query python
Name: python
Link: /usr/local/bin/python
Status: auto
Best: /usr/bin/python3.9
Value: /usr/bin/python3.9

Alternative: /home/etzimopoulos/anaconda3/bin/python3
Priority: 40

Alternative: /usr/bin/python2
Priority: 20

Alternative: /usr/bin/python3.9
Priority: 60

(base) etzimopoulos@dell-ubuntu-vm:~/Google-Drive/Career/Data Science/GitHub/python-coding-framework$ update-alternatives --query python3
Name: python3
Link: /usr/local/bin/python3
Status: auto
Best: /usr/bin/python3.9
Value: /usr/bin/python3.9

Alternative: /usr/bin/python3.9
Priority: 80

****** Final solution ******
In the end, a simple alias worked:
Step 1 - Added the following to .bashrc 
    alias python="python3.9"

Step 2 - Restarted .bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Worked. Now "python --version" gives me 3.9.13, while "python3 --version" gives me the default python 3.7.6

Also, removed all the update alternatives for "python" or "python3"

Sorted!
